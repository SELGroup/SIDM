# SIDM
Repository for the paper Effective Reinforcement Learning Based on Structural Information Principles.

a novel and general Structural Information principles-based framework for effective Decision-Making, namely SIDM, approached from an information-theoretic perspective.

a general framework and can be flexibly integrated with various single-agent and multi-agent RL algorithms, enhancing their performance.
Extensive and empirical experiments are conducted on a visual gridworld, nine continuous control tasks, six bipedal and four 7-DoF fetching robotic tasks, and a StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.<br>
